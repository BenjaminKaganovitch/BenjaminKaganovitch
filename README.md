### Hello Git! 👋



I am a dedicated and ambitious software developer with a secondary passion for cybersecurity and quantum computing. Currently, I'am duel enrolled at both Fort Richmond Colligate and Manitoba Institute of Trades and Technology, studying software development.  .

I have valuable experience as a software developer at CanU Canada, where I created front-end and back-end applications to accept and manage program applications, attendance records, and scholarship applications. I also served as the Chief Technology Officer of an e-commerce company that I co-founded. Further, I worked as the program developer and lecturer for the CanU Canada Physics Program, based within the University of Manitoba campus.

As a competitor in numerous cybersecurity contests, including the Canadian Cyber Defense Challenge, Cyber Patriot, and CyberTitans, I have consistently scored high marks and even earned a silver place as team captain. I was excited to return as the team captain for this year's CyberTitans competition in 2023, where we placed 4th.

I have also completed various certifications, including the Qubit x Qubit Introduction to Quantum Computing, Dell Client, and Cisco certifications, which have enabled me to develop a comprehensive skill set and a profound comprehension of the latest technologies and industry best practices.

## Skills
